Thus, there is a deadweight loss associated with the trade of ticket prices. We see this happen a lot on third-party ticket website like Stubhub or SeatGeek.\r\n\r\nWith this project, we attempted to gather and explore the ticket prices posted on Seatgeek.com and their relationship to NBA data. SeatGeek is 3rd party website for tickets - users are able to buy/sell tickets for any sports/concerts.\r\n\r\nThus, we wanted to look at how different factors affect the ticket pricing.\r\n* What factors affect the ticket price at a given moment?\r\n* Using today's information, can we predict the ticket price a week from now?\r\n\r\nThese are the questions we attempted to answer through our data science process, using some familiar algorithms (eg. ridge, lasso regression, elastic net) in an effort to predict the ticket price change. Due to the limit of the API, we were forced to predice the \"lowest good deal price\": lowest ticket price for a seat SeatGeek determines a \"good deal\". The average metric could be skewed by a very expensive courtside ticket, and the cheapest ticket could might offer a very disappointing view of the game.\r\n\r\n### Motivation:\r\n\r\nEvent tickets are interesting to study among other commodities. First, it loses its value after the time of the event has passed. Next, many different factors affect its price. The demand can be influenced by many different factors such as number of top stars or the team's winning percentage. In addition, one would treat a basketball ticket differently on when the team plays. \r\nIf you were no longer able to make the concert/sports game due to an exam, work, or illness, how would you determine at what price to sell? Is the buyer committed to buy at that price? Thus, we found this problem to interesting to study and wanted to dive deep into the process work to study this phenomenon. \r\n\r\n### Data Cleaning\r\n\r\nWe collected those information and extensively cleaned the data to merge them into one big data frame based on keys. We were able to collect data of more than 7 days. There are about 6000 different ticket information available. \r\n\r\n### Initial Data Exploration\r\n\r\nWe were initially very curious to see explore the following visualizations and questions:\r\n* How do lowest_price_good change over time?\r\n* How does the price of tickets change in relative to the Team's NBA Ranking/Winning Percentage?\r\n* How do different factors (sports rating, attendance, salary, other ticket info) affect the ticket price?\r\n \r\nWe wanted to see how individual factors might affect the lowest \"good deal\" ticket price over time. We looked at how factors like holidays such as Christmas and New Years (shown by vertical red lines), weekends (red shaded regions), the away team's rank (red) and winning percentage (green) affect the ticket price (blue). \r\n\r\n![alt text](https://7c0a817f-a-ed83d6ea-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/college.harvard.edu/seatgeekcs109/dataset-1/morning%20chart.png?attachauth=ANoY7coLW-cG_epyvftyre4F8lubbNjrRTtCYQnKhhbhAb2sEnEJboGfgBn4-7n_Vz7McNqS0tuCWu3AZsK6hTCykLRBBVZ6dy9pBH3GF-InE_DDPuXHIrtyNkKvgRQMwwfyGSV6G7IYf24hiczKxUuOkcKwx_qOjz3vvItHUHWnVaoMHIM35imogYeru5CmHbqrrIhkaxs1ZarvVV4THr5U2sOG0SX5z1A7tSba3BSOVzgAaVL08os%3D&attredirects=0 \"Per Team Analysis\")\r\n\r\nThe effect of holidays (i.e. Christmas) and weekend is accented for a high performing team like the Warriors. Also, the effect of star players is shown, for example, in Lakers: people want to see Kobe Bryant, a NBA legend, play before he retires this season. So, the end of the season sees a huge spike in ticket price. Finally, when you look at Portland Trail Blazers, you see that rank and ticket price are highly correlated before Jan 30. Then, the ticket prices and **winning percentage** are highly correlated. We applied similar techniques to determine which factors were relevant to the model and which relationship is best appropriate to represent them in the model. \r\n\r\n### Method\r\n\r\n##### Today's Price\r\nWe tested our prediction with 4 different models (OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net) on 3 different combinations of parameters. We ran cross-validation to determine Lasso with only the relevant parameters produced the highest accuracy. We look at MSEs(Mean Squared Errors) and MADs(Mean Absolute Derivations) between predicted and actual ticket prices to determine determine the performance of the model.\r\n![alt text](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/doiPFH_2PJDCXsalh94L0xNHgWPrHLPJYFg2bGN7Jiu1jUBdZVyxskQdwscbFf42wYSHujFfY1V3QZO6p9KBnbn5Gj84o0YTEuymTHsEEh0bgyoha_PhND7IlIDp7s1tntFpgMAJ \"Today MSE\")\r\nThe lasso regression with intuitive explanatory variables is the best model to predict the price because it has the smallest MSE.\r\n![alt text](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bbLkzyImlgt6iUZX7FyNmgjqkrYdbdVw3j82lWWSPya0OsvFmHhakkBZK_xrzLpJcIABoNNe9NY_FBIDhqIF-aumGPnbNfrdv7lfYKDVd9NcQaoxOvtUY1LSrT1OVcbul9mWf6TH \"Today MAD\")\r\nThe lasso regression with intuitive explanatory variables is the best model to predict the price because it has the smallest MAD.\r\n\r\nWe then validated the Best Predictive Model on the Validation Set to Determine Unbiased Prediction Error.\r\n\r\n|  \t| Best Model Accuracy \t| Baseline Accuracy \t|\r\n|:----:\t|:-------------------:\t|:-----------------:\t|\r\n| RMSE \t| 7.31 \t| 10.41 \t|\r\n| MAD \t| 3.80 \t| 3.94 \t|\r\n\r\nThe improvement with our model is shown in the decrease in RMSE.\r\n\r\n#### Next Week's Price\r\nA week is long enough for a ticket to significantly change in price. We are comapring the data from 11/29/2015 and 12/06/2015. We regress the price in a week on various predictors, similar to the step above. \r\n![alt text](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lANRB175XI5a0u7xJZKBqZ7LL15yn9VN-CRB67xlQEEi5Wp17WaJbYbMMY_aW_K2k1TWIeaT0fYOAfHqbuZjwnAhbJ7IKzYbNqpZ89pF2RTrbq3G0kSC5TMuNp-NVEKxoGBZtamF \"Next Week MSE\")\r\n![alt text](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/w1TmDypc59vC7l89-qseDhAdBh9zTSl6eeNBglhnS_W2zOgN9m_hCNXQLTBlB3AhYxvtXCGxZQadeE5OdZMqSFjzrGH_7JSCAMq7YpzGhwJ7gqM_TvuA1BmtawausP69vFjaqocY \"Next Week MAD\")\r\nThe Elastic Net and Lasso Regression with intuitive explanatory variables perform very well.
