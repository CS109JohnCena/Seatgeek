{"name":"Seatgeek.GitHub.io","tagline":"NBA 3rd party ticket price prediction","body":"###Team Members:\r\nBryan Baek, Walker Evans, Takehiro Matsuzawa\r\n\r\n###Data Sources:\r\n* SeatGeek's API NBA ticket data \r\n* ESPN NBA daily team standings data \r\n* ESPN NBA attendance data \r\n* ESPN NBA top salary \r\n* Wikipedia number of professional teams in US cities\r\n\r\n###Project Overview:\r\n\r\nTicket prices are very volatile. The ticket themselves are priced based on supply and demand. Thus, without a sure way to price the tickets, the tickets are priced arbitrarily, and it's either priced higher or lower than the market demand. Thus, there is a deadweight loss associated with the trade of ticket prices. We see this happen a lot on third-party ticket website like Stubhub or SeatGeek.\r\n\r\nWith this project, we attempted to gather, explore, and exploit ticket prices posted on Seatgeek.com and their relationship to sports data. SeatGeek is 3rd party website for tickets - users are able to buy/sell tickets for any sports/concerts.\r\n\r\nThus, we wanted to look at how different factors affect the ticket pricing.\r\n* What factors affect the ticket price at a given moment?\r\n* Using today's information, can we predict the ticket price a week from now?\r\n\r\nWe looked at NBA which is currently in season at the time of the project. We used SeatGeek's API to pull information about an basketball game's ticket information. Next, we scraped relevant sports data (i.e. ranking, winning percentage) from ESPN. These are the questions we attempted to answer through our data science process, using some familiar algorithms (eg. ridge, lasso regression, linear SVM regression) in an effort to predict the ticket price change.\r\n\r\n###Motivation:\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, Bryan did a case study on Boston's AceTickets. Event tickets are interesting to study among other commodities. First, it loses its value after the time of the event has passed. Thus, the ticket price changes quite dramatically depending on how close the ticket is from the event time. Next, many different factors affect the price. Because of limited quantity of tickets for a given event, the price is heavily influenced by its demand. The demand can be influenced by many different factors. One would pay higher to watch a really good team, or one would pay more to watch a famous sport star like Kobe Bryant before he retires in 2016 even if his team is performing very poorly. In addition, one would treat a basketball ticket differently if the game was on a weekend or holiday vs Monday or Tuesday night. We saw this a lot on the social media. For example, a friend would no longer able to make the concert/sports game due to an exam, work, or illness and would sell off the ticket on the social media page. How does she determine at what price she should sell, and is the buyer committed to buy at that price? Thus, we found this problem to interesting to study and wanted to dive deep into the process work to study this phenomenon. \r\nRelated Work:\r\n\r\nWebsites like Kayak and Seatgeek try to educate the consumers by displaying a \"good deal\" chart for airplane tickets and event tickets, respectively. The data scientists at these places conduct their own analogy (http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/the-math-behind-ticket-bargains/). Unfortunately, the general public does not have the access to the API that looks at individual tickets and seating.  While their strategy is useful, we wanted to follow an adopted strategy to answer the similar question but using different approach (using general linear regressions). \r\n\r\n###Initial Questions:\r\n\r\nWe initially tried to answer how ticket prices evolve over time depending on team performance and seat information factors. First, we tried to use Stubhub.com's data because it is a more prominent 3rd party ticket website. However, Stubhub API only gave the public a limited number of requests, and we were eventually timed out. We decided to use more user-friendly SeatGeek's API. Unfortunately, due to the API policy, we were not able to scrape the information about individual tickets. The open API only shows you a general ticket information. Thus, you only see the lowest, lowest good, average, and highest ticket price of an event, and no information about whether this specific seat is being sold or not. The lowest good ticket price refers to the cheapest ticket that SeatGeek algorithm deems it's a good deal. Highest ticket price was deemed too volatile, and the average ticket price would be subject to too much variation; it would have confounding effect from the distribution for the ticket prices that we can not account for. The lowest ticket price has a problem as well; it might show you the most undesirable ticket such as standing ticket or a seat with a blocked/poor view. Thus, we rephrased our original question to answer how different factors affect the lowest good deal ticket price. The factors include ticket information from SeatGeek: location/venue, number of tickets, date of the game, number of days away from the game. We chose to ignore SeatGeek's assigned score on the venues and home/away teams because they were calculated in black-box setting, and we don't know their method of derivation. We also looked at sports data: the number of highly-paid stars/winning percentage/winning streak of home and away teams, its current rank in the NBA. We looked at the percentage of attendance data on the respective teams playing; higher percentage would mean that their team has a lot of attendees.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
